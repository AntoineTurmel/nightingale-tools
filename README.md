nightingale-tools
=================

This repo is a set of tools for Nightingale.

buildbot: it's a bash script to compile Nightingale if there are changes on the repo.
You have to configure it yourself by editing it, future versions will be better ;)
You can put an entry in cron to build everyday.

TODO :
  * Make the script work on Windows and Mac OS X
  * On Windows we need to provide .zip/.exe (builded with InnoSetup)
  * The script should also be able to build public releases
